This is a web-based testing application used for easily managing and administering testing for kindergartners related to their reading and writing level.

The test itself, such as questions and images, are provided by [MTSU](https://www.mtsu.edu) professors and related to their research.

The entire application itself was a test of the Rust ecosystem and how well it would play with WASM. None of this would be possible without [Dioxus](https://dioxuslabs.com/) and the great community behind it.
